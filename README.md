# MGObfuscator
Please select the Target MGObfuscate and build it before running playground or Test target.
Project will only compile with Xcode 10 as it is using CommonCrpto which is not shipped in former versions.
I have not compiled CommonCrpto (I might do it later). Follow this link for compiling for previous versions (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25248598/importing-commoncrypto-in-a-swift-framework
)
